What is V2V?

Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) is an automobile technology designed to allow automobiles to “talk” to each other i.e., to communicate with each other.
 
 
Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication’s ability to wirelessly exchange information
about the speed and position of surrounding vehicles shows great promise in help-
ing to avoid crashes, ease traffic congestion, and improve the environment. But the
greatest benefits can only be achieved when all vehicles can communicate with each
other thanks to appropriate software (or safety applications). Vehicle-to-vehicle
(V2V) communication is an automobile technology designed for dedicated short-
range communication (DSRC) to allow vehicles to communicate with one another.
Scope of V2V Connection

In my project i implemented a program by which every vehicle which are on the
same server can interact with each other.
Therefore, here i created a server and client. Where i developed a server for a
particular road and a client as a vehicle. By that, if any vehicle will enter on the road
having a server, vehicle will connect to that server and can interact with all other
vehicles and can get an information about that road. Like, traffic, road accident, police
activities etc.
